    "* The input image is divided into an S × S grid of cells. Each grid cell is responsible for predicting B bounding boxes and their confidence scores, as well as C class probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The bounding box predictions include the coordinates (x, y) of the box center relative to the grid cell, the width (w) and height (h) of the box relative to the entire image, and a confidence score that indicates how certain the model is that the box contains an object.\n",
    "* Thus for each grid cell, the model predicts a total of B * 5 + C values.\n",
    "* Confidence Score = Pr(Object) * IOU(pred, truth) (It is for the bounding box)\n",

    "* If a cell contains a ground-truth object (object center in cell), among the B box predictors that cell has, the one with highest IoU (with that ground truth box) is chosen as responsible. The loss is only calculated for that bounding box predictor. The other bounding box predictors in that cell are ignored for that object.\n",

    "* The loss function used in YOLOv1 is a combination of multiple components that measure the accuracy of the model's predictions. These components include:\n",
    "  - Localization Loss: Measures the error in the predicted bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h) for the boxes responsible for detecting objects.\n",
    "  - Confidence Loss: Measures the error in the confidence scores for both the boxes that contain objects and those that do not.\n",
    "  - Classification Loss: Measures the error in the predicted class probabilities for the grid cells that contain objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* During inference, the model outputs a tensor of shape S x S x (B * 5 + C) for each input image. This tensor contains the predicted bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class probabilities for each grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is applied to filter out overlapping bounding boxes and retain only the most confident ones for each detected object."
